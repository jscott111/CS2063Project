# CS2063Project
This is my 21 Questions app for my Android Development class. This game guesses what sport or superhero you are thinking of by answering a series of questions about the sport or superhero

I pushed this project to GitHub after finding it again in my Android Studio project folder. At the time, the project wouldn't run anymore for some reasons I couldn't quickly figure out but I assumed it had to do with not having the proper jave environments installed and a path set.

If you can clone it and try it out, then have fun!
